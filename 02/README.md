A counter app that demonstrates usage of [d3-component](https://github.com/curran/d3-component). Inspired by [Redux Counter Example](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/counter).

The following components are defined and used to construct the app:

 * `app` <br>The top-level app component. <br><br> 
 * `buttonPanel` <br>The panel that contains the two buttons. This shows a simple composition pattern in which props are passed through to child components. <br><br> 
 * `button` <br> A generic Button component. <br><br> 
 * `countDisplay` <br> A display of the current count.
